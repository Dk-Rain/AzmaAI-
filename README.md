Azma AI — Your AI-Powered Academic Assistant

From Topic to Paper in Minutes**

Azma AI** is a next-generation web application built to transform the way students, educators and researchers produce academic documents. Rather than simply generating text, Azma AI takes you through the full journey: you provide a topic or assignment brief, and the system delivers a structured, formatted, reference-verified, submission-ready document.



🚀 Why Azma AI?

Writing assignments, theses or research articles today often means juggling formatting guidelines, citation styles, verifying sources, and ensuring originality. That’s time-consuming, error-prone and distracts from the core thinking and research. Azma AI solves this by combining powerful large-language-model (LLM) generation with verified academic data (e.g., DOIs), citation style automation and export-ready document formatting.
You get:

* Automatic academic-style structuring (Intro → Lit Review → Methods → Discussion → Conclusion)
* Real, verified references with DOIs via trusted APIs
* Automatic formatting (margins, spacing, fonts, styles) and export to Word (.docx) or PDF
* Multilingual and multi‐discipline support so you’re not locked into one subject or language



📋 Core Features

* **Enter Your Topic** – Simply input your assignment prompt, thesis title or research question.
* **Generate & Format** – Azma AI writes and formats the document in your chosen style (APA, MLA, IEEE, Harvard) with correct headings, TOC, page numbers and more.
* **Download & Submit** – Export your ready‐to‐submit paper as a fully formatted Word or PDF file.
* **Verified References** – Cited works are checked for legitimacy and DOIs; no more fake or broken references.
* **Multiple Templates** – Support for essays, term papers, research proposals, theses, lab reports and journal article formats.
* **Plagiarism-aware Output** – Built-in checks to help keep content original (for full compliance with academic integrity policies).
* **Safe & Private** – User data and document content remain secure and confidential throughout the process.


🎓 How It Works

1. **Input** your topic or document brief (e.g., “Classes of health challenges in Nigeria’s healthcare sector, 15 pages, APA style”).
2. Azma AI **generates** an outline and full sections (Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Findings, Discussion, Conclusion) with content drafted, referenced and formatted.
3. You **download** the output in .docx or .pdf, ready for review or submission.
